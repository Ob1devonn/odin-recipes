        <h1>Chicken and Dumplings</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is one of my <em>favorite</em> recipes I have stumbled upon on the web. 
            If you aren't all too familiar with it, this is a bit of a soup with biscuits 
            topped over. Sorta, like a chicken potpie with biscuit, instead of crust. 
            This warms any winter day and fill any craved stomach.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a 6-quart dutch oven, pour olive oil 
                and brown the chicken breasts. Once browned, 
                remove chicken from pot and place to the side.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Place 2 tbs of oil and saute onion and carrots
                 combined until fragrant and tender(5 mins). Pla
                 ce on low heat and add garlic, lightly stirring for
                  2 minutes. Add any seasons of desire at this point, 
                  or stick to just salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Add butter to the pot melting and coating before 
                pouring flour evenly to create a thick roux. 
                Make sure to sure constantly, preventing clumping for 2 minutes. 
                Add chicken and drippings, stirring and scrapping loose the sugars 
                at the bottom of the pan for 3 minutes, while loosening the roux and 
                coat the chicken.
            </li>
            <br> 
            <li>Now, add broth, cream, thyme and bay leaves to pot. Raise the heat to 
                <strong>medium-high</strong> to bring the soup to a simmer, proceeding 
                to add frozen peas and cover. Leave this to cook for 15 minutes while 
                prepping dumplings.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>In a large bowl, add dry ingredients for dumplings, whisk to evenly 
                distribute. Once combined, add heavy cream and stir lightly to form a 
                large mass. <em>Using your hands,</em> incorporate any dry ingredients 
                into the mass <em>without kneading</em>. Pull bits from mass and roll 
                into 2 inch balls of dough until, none of the mass is left.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Place the balls of dough, evenly spaced, into pot of soup, coating the 
                top with parsley and covering with lid to cook for 15 minutes, or until 
                dough is cooked.
            </li>
